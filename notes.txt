#Quadratic function of distance between em and target (after his next jump)
#(the same as a surprisal)
#Exact free energy == surprisal
#Don't need VFE

#(Chapter 7 James Probability Theory the Logic of Science)

#Comparing inferred: actually means that false inference can lead to less surprise






#Gaussian expectation about my position being close to the targets position
#learning rate = 1/(lambda+1)






#Inference on exponential families using mean tracking

#Extend to non-staitonarity

#Extend to active inference

#Have a look at the math
