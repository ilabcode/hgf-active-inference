#Quadratic function of distance between em and target (after his next jump)
#(the same as a surprisal)
#Exact free energy == surprisal
#Don't need VFE

#Comparing inferred: actually means that false inference can lead to less surprise











#Inference on exponential families using mean tracking

#Extend to non-staitonarity

#Extend to active inference

#Have a look at the math
